# calculator

Create an interactive calculator that takes in a value, then an operator, then another value. Upon receiving these values, ensure the calculator calculates, displays and stores the answer and then uses that answer going forward for the next calculation. Then repeat this process until the all clear function is pressed or a divison by zero is attempted. Display "Nice Try" for attempted divison by zero and reset the input. Include a highlight feature so the currently selected operator is highlighted. Include buttons for all clear, clear, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and equals. Also add functions for entering decimals and changing the sign of the input as well as for entering the digits 0-9. Allow entering up to 20 digits for input.
